# TK UI
Generic GUI for controlling Sushi over gRPC, built with python and Tk. Can control both local instances and remote devices. Intended for testing and development and not for externa use. UI is very ugly and the code not up to standard for publishing.

## Usage

	$ python3 ./client.py

Make sure to set the path to Sushis protofile before. If controlling Sushi on a remote device, change the ip from localhost to the ip of the elk device.
